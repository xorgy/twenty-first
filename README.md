# Twenty-First

Derivative and expansion of C059, the scotch font fonts originally published by URW++ as part of their Core 35 metric-compatible PostScript fonts for use in GhostScript.

## Goals

 - Ditching low-quality symbols, so that a fallback font can display them better.
 - Adding slots for alternate encodings (e.g. U+2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN should map to hyphen-minus) of certain glyphs.
 - Improving kerning across supported languages.
 - Harmonizing outlines, to enable a multi-master variable font.

## Non-goals

 - Retaining metric compatibility with Century Schoolbook.

URW++, after being acquired by Monotype, has abandoned maintenance of these fonts, and deleted the original repository where they published the font files. Part of the original repository's README, describing the licensing history of these fonts, is preserved below:

In 1999-2000, URW++ Design and Development GmbH released the Type 1 implementations of the Core 35 fonts under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the Aladdin Ghostscript Free Public License (AFPL). In 2009, URW++ additionally released the same fonts under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL).

In 2016, URW++ released a major Version 2.0 upgrade to the Core 35 fonts. This version is an extensive reworking of the original Core 35 fonts, with improved font outlines, and greatly extended character sets, including Cyrillic and Greek. Also, some font names have been changed. Version 2.0 is released in Type 1, OpenType-CFF and OpenType-TTF formats. URW++ released the Version 2.0 of the fonts under the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 (AGPL) with an exemption.

In 2017, URW++ additionally released the same Version 2.0 fonts under the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) Version 1.3c, and under the SIL OpenFont License (OFL), Version 1.1, without a "Reserved Font Name" clause.

Please note that the three licenses apply only to the original Version 2.0 fonts, as released by URW++.

If you use the fonts, you may choose which license is most suitable for you. If you extend or modify the fonts, you may release your modified versions under any combination of the three licenses.

Please consult the [LICENSE](./LICENSE.md) document for the text of the licenses.
